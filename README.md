Takeaway Challenge
====================
This application can be used by a restaurant to create a menu, display it for customers, then allow them to create an order of specific items on it. When an order is created the customer inputs the total amount due, and the order is placed. An update can be issued to the customer by text message, letting them know their order is in process and an approximate delivery time, normally 1 hour after ordering

### Build Status
Currently classes have been created for items, menu and order. A message class has also been created for use with the text messaging API, but has currently not yet been implemented
